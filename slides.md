<!--
* The Dura-Europos synagogue consistutes of of the oldest known examples of Jewish art.
  * One striking thing about this depiction of David is that he is portrayed as an essentially Greek or Roman figure.
  * This David takes the form of a beardless Hellenistic youth and is anointed by a toga-wearing Samuel.
* The depiction in the synagogue is joined by a nearby third century Christian church, which also features depictions of David, notably his battle with Goliath.
  * For more on this, see [Michael Peppard](https://www.ancientjewreview.com/read/2016/4/18/david-as-warrior-at-dura-europos).

<!--
* This portrayal utilizes the atheletic ideal of the Renaissance-era revival of the *classical* ideal.
* David is dragged through time into a 16th century appropriation of a 5th century BC Greek ideal.
* This particular work has become, in turn, an exemplar of that Renaissance appropriation.

# 2 Sam 7:5–16
“Go and tell my servant David, ‘Thus says the Lord: … When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom….
And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me.
Your throne shall be established forever.’”

# Psalm 89:29–35
“I will establish [David’s] offspring forever and his throne as the days of the heavens.
If his children forsake my law… then I will punish their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with stripes, but I will not remove from him my steadfast love or be false to my faithfulness.
I will not violate my covenant or alter the word that went forth from my lips.
Once for all I have sworn by my holiness; I will not lie to David.”

Jer 31:31–34: “The days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah.
It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt... This is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel after that time,” declares the Lord.
“***I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts.***
I will be their God, and they will be my people.
***No longer will they teach their neighbor***, or say to one another, ‘Know the Lord,’ because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest,” declares the Lord.
“For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.”

Jer 33:14–16: “‘The days are coming,’ declares the Lord, ‘when I will fulfill the good promise I made to the people of Israel and Judah. In those days and at that time I will make a righteous Branch sprout from David’s line; he will do what is just and right in the land. In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live in safety. This is the name by which it will be called: The Lord Our Righteous Savior.’”
